As a player I want to be able to view the board state of the game so that I can decide what my course of action will be and how I want to continue.

As a player I want to be able to have an understandable ruleset that I can review to remember my win condition depending on the haunt.

As a player I want to be able to keep track of my current stat points and that of others if necessary such that I can know how many dice to roll and if I need to reduce or add to my stats.
